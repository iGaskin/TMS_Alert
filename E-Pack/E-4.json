{"NIV": {"verse": "\"Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, ''God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.'' Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.\"", "reference": "\"1 Peter 5:5-6\""}}
